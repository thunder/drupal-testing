### Functions ###

# Output help to console.
show_help() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage:   ${0##*/} [-h|--help] [-nc|--no-cleanup] [STAGE]
Run tests for a drupal project (module, ditribution or full project). This has to be called from the projects folder.
It builds a drupal installation and runs all tests that are defined in the projects directory.
You can run this multiple times with different stages, already executed stages will not be called
again until run_tests stage has finished. After run_tests everything will be cleaned up, and another
run would start from scratch.

Parameter:
    STAGE                    The test stage to execute, defaults to run_test (all stages are executed).
                             If a stage depends on other stages, they will be automatically called.
                             Possible values: requirements, coding_style, prepare_build, build,
                             install, start_services, run_tests
Options:
    -h,  --help              Display this help.
    -nc, --no-cleanup        Do not cleanup after successful tests. Set this option to keep the installation.
    -so, --stage-only        Run a stage exclusively without calling their dependencies.
    -co, --clean-only        Just run cleanup and exit.
    -v, --verbose            Verbose output

Example:
    test-drupal-module               Run everything.
    test-drupal-module coding_style  Just test coding style.
    test-drupal-module build         Build the projects docroot, but does not install or test yet.
